            <p>Welcome to this little extra journal I put together for my boyfriend. I originally planned this as a small gift for him, but I ended up expanding on it and adding my own ideas. This adorable notebook holds our memories together, and I hope it continues to grow along with our future. The original design was created by <a href="https://nenrikido.neocities.org/">nenrikido</a>—I just made a few edits, so all credit goes to her! Anyway, I hope this journal grows just like our love does. I'm so happy to be with him, and I love him so much. As I've mentioned before, my website is mostly a place to store the things I love and cherish, so creating things like this brings me a lot of joy!<p>

          <article class="content">
            <p>When we met months ago, we immediately had a special connection and became best friends. You were always sweet, funny, and somehow laughed at my pointless jokes. I noticed in you how talented you were, as well as being a pretty smart and driven guy, and I immediately knew you would have a bright future. We spent hours talking about topics, chatting about our lives, and playing around, we even talked about our silly stories. I love the way you smile, I love your laugh, and how we would burst out laughing together at our shared humor. Every day got better because of you, and I was so grateful to have you in my life and to have met you. You were just lovely and always supported me and gave me love as my best friend, I felt like I could trust you with everything I felt, because you became my safe place.</p>
            
            <p>As time went by, you became more than just a friend, but a life partner and someone important to me. I still remember our first conversations... I keep them in my heart. You captivated me, and I finally fell in love with you so much that I was afraid to tell you. I was afraid of ruining that beautiful friendship that we had built over time, trust and affection for each other. Your presence feels like the sun and its light, so soft and warm. My love, you are so special. I constantly look at you, I see your beautiful cinnamon-colored skin so shiny and perfect, your lips, your tender nose and your entire adorable face.</p>
            <p>I look at you, and I see how your skin is a canvas where the sun has left its mark, a warm hue that reminds me of golden honey at sunset or fertile soil after the rain. It is a deep tone, full of life, that shines under the light like polished bronze and keeps in its essence the warmth of summer days and the elegance of the starry night. Your beautiful curly hair and your body, as sublime and well polished as a marble statue. My God, it makes me think of the wonders I could do for you. I see you and I fall in love even more. I see your body and face framed in paintings in museums. You are beautiful, sweetheart. Thank you for being in my life, thank you for allowing me to be by your side, thank you for taking care of me and supporting me when I need it most.</p>
            <p>With love, tu fresita, mi gatito.</p>

I will live forever loving you madly, my sweet love. A candle can light up our night together, but you are the fire that lies within it. My sweet boy. Gentle, sensitive, protective, caring... I love you.</p>

            <p>
              My love, your curly black hair is a perpetual dance of curls and waves that catch the light and the wind, a cascade of shadows and reflections that unfolds freely. Each curl is a secret whispered by the breeze, a story woven with the softness of silk and the strength of your ancestral roots. It is the night sky made of strands, it is the dark foam of an untamed sea, it is a sign of strength and beauty in its purest form. You are strong, you are wonderful. Every moment I listen to you, with your deep voice. Your skin color is that of wood polished by the wind, of bronze that has been touched by the light again and again until it shines with its own glow. Each deep shade is a map of history and strength, each shadow projected on your skin is an echo of life lived with intensity. When the light caresses you, your skin shines like amber in the darkness, like burning sand before nightfall.</p>
            <p>A nightfall that I adore with each of its stars and marks. Your body, marked by effort and perseverance, is a work sculpted with the precision of time and discipline. Your muscles are defined harmoniously under the skin, tensing and relaxing like the waves of a raging sea. Your torso is a field of strength and resistance, a balance between hardness and fluidity, where each line tells a story of struggle, of overcoming, of life in motion. I look at you, and beauty is not only there, but in your heart so pure that it has suffered for years from the unjust people around you.</p>
            <p>You are like a child in a man's body. I adore the way you get excited, the way you laugh and love me. I love seeing you fascinated by the small details, by the stars of our universe and your unstoppable passion for science and mathematics, reflecting your mind so enriched full of stories to tell and things to offer the world.</p>

            <p>Your laughter is like the glow of a supernova, dazzling and capable of lighting up entire galaxies in my chest. Your eyes contain the mystery of a deep sky, as if in their brightness they kept the secrets of the universe, the calm of the moon and the passion of a burning sun. Every time you look at me, it is like observing the Milky Way from the window of a ship lost in the vastness of space: immense, overwhelming, beautiful.</p>
            
            <p>I love you with the force with which the planets revolve around their stars, with the implacable gravity that keeps the orbits together. My heart gravitates towards yours like the Earth towards the Sun, because without you I would become a wandering star, condemned to wander aimlessly through infinity. You are my eclipse and my dawn, the dawn that colors every moment at your side. And even if time expands, even if the stars one day go out, my love for you will shine beyond this life, beyond this galaxy, in the eternity of infinity. I love everything about you and the stories we create together. You inspire me so much, I admire you so much, and you make me feel proud.</p>

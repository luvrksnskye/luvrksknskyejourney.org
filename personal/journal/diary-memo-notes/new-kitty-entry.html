Welcome home, dawn! <img src="../../../assets/gifs/catcup.gif">
<br><br>
Happy New Year to everyone! It's already 11:50 in my town, and we're welcoming a new member of the family soon. Meet Dawn! We just adopted this little baby, she's three months old and even though she's a bit shy, I'm happy that she's in my home. She's so tiny, she's the size of my hand and looks so fragile. She's beautiful and looks like a twin to my other cat, Midnight. I had dinner with my mom today and we welcomed Dawn, she arrived today in a box in the middle of a rainy day. Right now she's very shy and doesn't seem to have much confidence, but I'm sure that as the weeks and months go by, she'll fit in with this family very well!
<br><br>
She's so cute when we feed her. She really is just a little girl! Right now she sleeps in a big cage with lots of blankets and toys right next to my bed. I like to play with her a lot. She's so playful and adorable, she's obviously quite a sensitive and introverted cat.

 This tiny baby brought back so many memories! I was in the hospital and was hospitalized for a long time, when I found out on a call with my mom that they were planning to give me a new kitten to help with my mental health as part of my treatment. My previous kitten died of kidney failure and that had left me in a terrible mental state. I didn't feel like I had any reason to keep going, but when I knew that kitty would come to me, I felt like I needed the strength to be that caregiver for my little one. I remember the day that I met midnight vividly. A core memory!
  <br><br>
  When I got out of the hospital, we went to the animal shelter shortly after and met her, my sweet baby girl. When I saw her, I started crying with a mix of happiness and sadness, Midnight was only a baby about 2 months old and she was so tiny! Her little face was adorable, she climbed over the other cats and ran to me. I immediately hugged her and knew I had gotten a part of myself back that I lost. My therapist wrote a letter authorizing her to be an emotional support pet that same day and we took her home! She slept with me that night, curled up between my legs on the blue blanket on my bed.
  <br><br>
  Midnight's first few months were beautiful not because of her cuteness, but because she seemed to be literally an angel. This kitten captured my heart because she was so small and defenseless at first, and yet she clung to me as if she was trying to protect me. Midnight was always such a sweet and sensitive kitten. She was so small that she fit in the palm of my hand, and at the same time she was a chubby little ball of fur. She looks at me with loving eyes, and so do I. The first few months that passed we thought she was mute, because she didn't know how to meow like other cats and she never made any noise. It was after about her first year of age that she started talking more and for me it was like hearing the first words of a baby.
<br><br>
Midnight grew up, and very quickly! She spent most of her time outdoors with me, climbing trees, looking at the wild flowers, and playing with my greenhouse plants at home. I'm currently in a very rural place (it's literally surrounded by fields and forests), so I'm glad she was able to spend a lot of time outdoors because of that. She always kept me company. I'd take her outside in her vest and in her travel backpack. And our winters were also very warm because of her love. When it was cold, I loved to put my hands under her tummy to warm them up.
<br><br>
Now that Dawn is home, I can't wait for Midnight and her to be together as sisters. Dawn's tummy is so big and chubby! I want to kiss her so baddd!!

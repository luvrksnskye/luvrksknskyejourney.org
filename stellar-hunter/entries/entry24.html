  <p class="title">Gordo</p>
  <p class="star">————⋆✦⋆————</p>
  <br><br>
  You have found an Gordo star fragment! Let's see... Hmh... The roundest constellation pattern known to astronomy! Contains a star system that appears to change color seasonally, from golden to brown. Home to the densest collection of food-named asteroids in the known galaxy. Astronomers have documented a phenomenon called "The Great Wiggle" where the stars appear to shift like a breathing belly. The central star's spectrographic analysis shows elements commonly found in bread! Did you know that?
  <br><br>
  Stars arrange themselves in patterns resembling various food shapes in Gordo. Contains dust clouds that sparkle like falling crumbs! The central star cluster rotates like a spinning food bowl. Regularly observed phenomena called "dinner time sparkles" and astronomers report the area smells like cookies through spectral analysis.

  <p class="title">The Celestial Foodie</p>
  <br><br>
  The plump and happy constellation of Gordo spreads across the western horizon like a well-fed guardian. His stars form the shape of a chubby, lounging dog with a perpetually wagging tail. According to myth, Gordo was a baker's dog who would taste-test all the bread to ensure it was perfect, leading to his rounded figure. The gods were so charmed by his dedication to quality control that they honored him with a place among the stars. It's said that bakers who start their ovens when Gordo's constellation is brightest will have their bread rise perfectly.

  <p class="title">Cachi</p>
  <p class="star">————⋆✦⋆————</p>
  <br><br>
  You have found an Cachi star fragment! Let's see... Oh, Cachi!  its stars pulse at different frequencies, creating what astronomers call the "Tail-Wagging Pattern". The constellation appears to "move" more than others due to a unique arrangement of variable stars. Contains exactly 44 visible stars, said to represent each type of known dog breed at the time of its discovery. The central star cluster emits a frequency that matches the average frequency of a happy dog's bark! This star is beautiful, isn't it? Some myths say that Cachi is a very special constellation... On July 8, it shines brightest, and is most visible from both hemispheres. Some people believe that when you look at it, you can hear the little barks of a puppy in the night skies.
  <br><br>
  It's certainly very special! I wonder what other lost pets are waiting in the cosmos to return home to their families.

  <p class="title">The Canine Guardian</p>
  <br><br>
  In the northern sky lies Cachi, the Playful Protector, whose stars form the shape of a small, bouncing puppy eternally chasing its own tail. Ancient tales speak of a brave little dog who saved the Moon Goddess's favorite silver ball from rolling off the edge of the world. 
  <br><br>
  As a reward, she placed him in the stars, where his eternal dance of joy brings good fortune to all who play games under his twinkling form. Sailors particularly love spotting Cachi, as legend says his wagging tail points toward safe harbors.

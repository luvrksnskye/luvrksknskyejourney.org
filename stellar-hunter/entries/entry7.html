  Months of the year: Sep and Oct
  <p class="star">————⋆✦⋆————</p>
  <br><br>
  Wow! You've found a Libra star fragment! Let's see... Oh! Well, Libra is visible primarily in the Southern Hemisphere, but it can also be observed in the Northern Hemisphere at certain times of the year. The best time to observe Libra is during the spring months in the Northern Hemisphere, or during the fall in the Southern Hemisphere.
  <br><br>
  Libra is a zodiac constellation located in the southern hemisphere. It is located between the constellations Virgo and Scorpio, and is the only constellation of the zodiac that does not represent a human or animal-shaped figure, but an object: the scales. In Greek mythology, Libra is associated with Astrea, the goddess of justice, who carried a set of scales. According to legend, Astrea retreated from Earth due to the increasing corruption of humanity, and became the constellation Libra. In some versions, Libra represents the scales that weigh the souls of the dead to determine their fate.
  <br><br>
  The star seems to have something to tell you!

  <p class="title">The balance of the cosmos</p>
  <br><br>
  In a very special corner of the cosmos lived a boy who had a golden scale. This scale could weigh things that no one else could: it could weigh the light of the stars, the dreams and laughter of children.
The boy wore a bright blue suit. Every morning, he would tiptoe through the universe, carefully carrying his scale. His job was to make sure everything was perfectly balanced.
  <br><br>
  On one side of the scale he would put things like rays of sunlight, and on the other, bits of moonlight. He would weigh joy and sadness, day and night, cold and heat. If something was out of balance, he would fix it with a magical touch of his finger. He loved his job because he knew that thanks to him, the universe was kept in perfect harmony. When he was done, he would sit on a star to rest, happy to see how everything worked in perfect balance.

  You have found an Taurus star fragment! It's soft green and glows brightly! Taurus is home to the Cartwheel Nebula (CRL 618), which is a planetary nebula with a fascinating structure that looks like a torus or wagon wheel. In ancient Babylonian astrology, Taurus was associated with the goddess Ishtar, who represented love, fertility, and war. During spring in the Northern Hemisphere, when the Sun is in Taurus, it's a time associated with earth renewal and growth!
  <br><br>
 Taurus is a prominent constellation in the Northern Hemisphere and belongs to the zodiac group. It is located between the constellations of Aries and Gemini. It is also a fairly large constellation, occupying an area of ​​around 797 square degrees, making it one of the 20 largest constellations in the sky. Did you know that the brightest star in Taurus is Aldebaran, a red giant that represents the eye of the bull? Aldebaran is one of the 20 brightest stars in the sky and is located about 65 light-years away from Earth. Taurus is easily visible during the fall and winter months, especially between November and January. The Pleiades and Aldebaran are visible to the naked eye in a clear sky. If you're looking around at those times, Taurus will be one of the most noticeable constellations.
  <br><br>
  This fragment seems lost like their siblings... As you get closer, you hear a sweet melody coming from this piece of star. It is the soft laughter of a child. He wants to tell you his story!

  <p class="title">The Star Gardener</p>
  <br><br>
  In a very quiet corner of the cosmos lived a very patient and careful boy. He had a small silver watering can and a magical backpack full of star seeds. These seeds were special: they glowed as if they held all the dreams of the universe inside. Every night, the boy would put on his gardener’s overalls, decorated with bright moons, and go out to do his special job. He walked barefoot on the softest clouds, which he used as his garden in the sky. Very carefully, he would make small holes in the dark sky with a golden trowel, and in each one, he would plant a star seed.
  <br><br>
  To water his seeds, he used magical water he collected from the skies and the moon’s dew. He would sing lullabies while watering them because he knew that baby stars need a lot of love to grow big and bright. He didn’t mind waiting for a long time; he knew that the most beautiful things in the universe need time to be perfect. When he finished his work, he would sit on his favorite cloud, which was shaped like an armchair, and happily watch as his stars began to glow slowly.

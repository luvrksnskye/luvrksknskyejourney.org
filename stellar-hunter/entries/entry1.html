  You have found an Aries star fragment! Isn't she beautiful? It shines softly, it is small and white as snow... The Aries constellation is located in the Northern celestial hemisphere, between Taurus and Pisces. The constellation contains over 60 stars, including Hamal, Teegarden's Star, and 41 Arietis. The name Aries comes from the Latin word for ram!
  <br><br>
  This fragment seems lost... The constellation Aries is not one of the brightest constellations, so you'll need low light pollution to see it. The best time to look for Aries is in December at 10 PM, or in November at 8 PM, or in January at 6 PM. Oh, by the way, did you know that in ancient times, Hamal was an equinoctial star, meaning it was in conjunction with the sun at the spring equinox?
  <br><br>
  As you get closer, you hear a sweet melody coming from this piece of star. It's strange, it shines brighter and brighter, waiting for you to tell you its story. These stars have been lost for a long time, they have fallen from the sky and it seems that finally someone will help them to return home... I wonder... Will you be the one to hear the whispers of the lost stars?

  <p class="title">The little flame</p>
  <br><br>
  At the beginning of time, when the universe was just awakening, a very special little girl was born. She was so tiny that she could sit in the palm of a star, and her hair resembled a dancing flame. But it wasn’t an ordinary flame—it was a beautiful one that never went out and didn’t burn anything. This little girl could never stay still, not even for a moment. Her feet always wanted to dance, run, and jump. She wore a little dress made of golden light, and her shoes sparkled like tiny sparks when she ran. She loved exploring every corner of the world, especially those places where no one else dared to go.
  <br><br>
  While other children played in their gardens, she hopped from cloud to cloud, chased the stars, and played hide-and-seek with the wind. Her laughter was as bright as her hair, and wherever she went, she left a trail of light that made nocturnal flowers bloom and glow. Sometimes, the wind blew fiercely, and the rain poured down in torrents, but she wasn’t afraid. She danced with the raindrops and raced against the wind. Her light never faded because, within her heart, something very special burned: the desire to bring happiness to everyone she met along the way.
  <br><br>
  One day, the little girl got lost, but thanks to you, now she will return with her family.

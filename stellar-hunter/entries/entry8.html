  You've found a Scorpio star fragment! Your thirst for knowledge and your desire to explore new horizons always lead you towards the unknown. Keep reaching for the stars! Let's see... Scorpius is a prominent constellation of the zodiac located in the Southern Hemisphere, between the constellations of Libra and Sagittarius. It is especially visible in the skies of the Southern Hemisphere, but can also be observed from the Northern Hemisphere during the summer months. In Greek mythology, Scorpius is associated with the scorpion that, according to legend, killed the hunter Orion.
  <br><br>
  Scorpius is visible in the Southern Hemisphere during the spring and summer months, and is best seen between the months of June and September. In the Northern Hemisphere, it is visible in the summer and in some parts of the fall, depending on the geographic location. The constellation is located near the Milky Way, which makes it even more visually interesting.

  Wow, you've come a long way in capturing stars! You're almost there. And this star has a very special story for you:

  <p class="title">The keeper of secrets</p>
  <br><br>
  In a mysterious lake that reflected all the stars in the sky, there lived a very lonely boy. His eyes shone like two little moons and he wore a cloak made of soft shadows that made him appear invisible when he wanted to. This boy was the guardian of all the secrets of the universe. He kept the sighs of the stars, the wishes we make when we see a shooting star, and the songs that the moons sing to their planets when no one is looking.
  <br><br>
  He had a collection of magic chests where he kept each secret very carefully. Some chests shone with their own light, others made soft sounds like little bells when he opened them. The boy knew every secret and knew exactly where to keep it.

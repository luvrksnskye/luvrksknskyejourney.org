  You've found a Sagittarius star fragment! How many stars are missing to complete your collection? Cheer up! You're almost there.
  <br><br>
  The constellation Sagittarius is located in the southern quadrant of the sky, close to the Milky Way. It is situated between Scorpius in the west and Capricornus in the east, and is one of the best-known summer constellations in the northern hemisphere. Sagittarius is represented by an archer, a centaur with a horse's body and a human upper body. In the sky, the figure is interpreted as a centaur holding a bow and arrow. The arrow points towards the centre of the Milky Way, giving the impression that the archer is shooting towards the heart of our galaxy.
  <br><br>
 Sagittarius is most visible in the night sky during the summer in the Northern Hemisphere, but is visible almost year-round in the Southern Hemisphere. The best time to see it is around June to August...

  <p class="title">The Archer of Dreams</p>
  <br><br>
  Among all his brothers and sisters, there was a boy archer. He was no ordinary archer: instead of shooting normal arrows, he shot dreams into the infinite. His clothes were made of scraps of the Northern Lights, and his shoes had little wings that allowed him to fly while he shot his arrows. Each arrow carried a different dream: some were dreams of adventure, others of discovery, and some were simply dreams of happiness.
  <br><br>
  When he shot his arrows, they left bright trails in the sky that became new constellations. He didn't care if some arrows traveled far away; he knew that each one would find the perfect heart to plant its dream in. The boy archer never got tired of shooting dreams into the universe, because he knew that every dream he shot could make someone happy somewhere in the cosmos.
